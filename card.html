          Its remarkable size and abilities sanctify it from other rodents for
          many reasons. This rodent is very well adapted for land and water
          environments. It boasts a record of five minutes holding its breath
          underwater and has webbed feet for enhanced aquatic movement. This
          extraordinary guinea pig is also quite social and has been known to
          get along "swimmingly" with other species such as domestic dogs.
